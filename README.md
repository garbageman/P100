# P100
## Projects designed for introductory programming

## Overview
This is a repository full of programming prompts that are to help beginner programmers.
There will be different sections and the projects in each section will relate or
fall under the category of that section.

### Set up
Just fork and clone and poke around. If you have any project ideas that
you want to add, feel free to create a project and make a pull request. If you
are creating a new project that you feel fits between say, P3 and P4, feel free
to create a P3a or whatever letter comes next if that name is already taken.

### Testing
Each project comes with a testing suite that relies on unix commands.
Feel free to create your own tests but if you want to use the tests
supplied for a particular project then run "python test.py" in the directory
for that project. You should get feedback on your program.
